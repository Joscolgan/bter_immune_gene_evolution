## Context & citation

This repository contains all scripts used for the population genomic analysis of immune genes in a contemporary population of _Bombus terrestris_ males sampled across Ireland. This project was supported by a Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) Conservation of Genetic Resources grant with assistance from the Irish Research Council (IRC) and the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU). Computational analyses were supported by the Irish Centre for High-End Computing (ICHEC).  
Findings are reported in the following manuscript:
